# review_checker

it a nlp based machine learning project which is based on bag of words model.the user can input his/her review and the algorithm will predict whether the review is
positive or negative.I have used regularisation techniques like dropout and l2 regularisation to prevent overfitting.The model is trained on 
about 28000 reviews.
